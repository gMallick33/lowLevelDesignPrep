- This is a creational design pattern.
- Student class require StudentBuilder interface.
- Director creates the Student object from StudentBuilder interface.
- Director has implementation of StudentBuilder for example EngineeringStudentBuilder;
- Director job is to follow some way to create the student.
- In some other case we may need to set some property first and then some propeerty after that.
- For example, when we build house, we can't build the roof first, we need to build foundation first and then wall.
- But in case student it doesn't really matter which property gets set first.
