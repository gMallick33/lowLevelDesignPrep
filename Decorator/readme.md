- Pizza class, and we can add many topping to pizza.
- consider farmhouse pizza. we can add cheese burst topping on it.
- now we can add mushroom toppings on it.
- now we add extra onion on the pizza.

- This is example for decorator pattern. We need not create another class for farmhouse + cheese burst + mushroom pizza. Instead we manage like this.
- topping is also a type of base pizza. topping has also a base pizza variable.
- Decorator pattern helps us in class explosion.
