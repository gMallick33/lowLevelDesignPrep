- Info, Debug, Error logging is an amazon question.
- if info can't handle then debug handles it.
- if debug can't handle it then error handles it
- else default handling happens.
- ATM machine, vending machine also come in this category.
- Each logProcessor has a nextLogProcessor, that is how the chain happens from info to debug to error.
