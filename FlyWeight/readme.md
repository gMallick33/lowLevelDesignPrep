- intrinsic - shared properties among objects
- extrinsic - not shared among objects
- keep the intrinsic properties in the class
- when memory is limited and properties can be shared among objects, and creating objects is expensinve then flyweight pattern is used.

- we create one object and use the same object for displaying at different (x, y) positions.
